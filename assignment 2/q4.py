Given the participants' score sheet for your University Sports Day. you are required to find the runner-up score.
             You are given n scores. Store them in a list and find the score of the runner-up.
            Input Format: The first line contains n . The second line contains an array A[] of n integers each separated by a space.
            Constraints : 2≤n≤5
                                     -100≤A[i]≤100
            Output Format : Print the runner-up score.
            Sample Input : 5
                                          2 3 6 6 5
             Sample Output : 5
